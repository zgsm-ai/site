# Costrict Deployment Guide

To help you deploy Costrict more efficiently, this document provides a clear installation manual. You can choose between the following two deployment methods:

1. [Install the Extension](#install-the-extension)
2. [Install the Extension and Deploy Backend Services](#install-the-extension-and-deploy-backend-services)

**Method 1** is suitable for new users to experience Costrict quickly. It works out-of-the-box but uses official server resources, which may limit performance due to resource constraints.

**Method 2** is recommended for long-term use with optimal performance. We provide a one-click installation script requiring minimal server resources.
